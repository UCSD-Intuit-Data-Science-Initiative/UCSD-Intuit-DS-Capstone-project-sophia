    "##Workforce Optimization: From Demand to Supply\n",
    "\n",
    "The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You are managing a customer support operation. Every 30 minutes, you receive forecasts.\n",
    "- Demand: Expected volume of customer contacts (e.g., 500 calls)\n",
    "- AHT: Average handle time per contact (e.g., 180 seconds)\n",
    "- Constraints: Service level agreements (e.g., 80% of calls answered within 20 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Task: Determine the minimum number of agents (supply) needed to meet service levels while minimizing cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why This Is Hard\n",
    "\n",
    "This is NOT a simple Erlang-C lookup problem. Real-world complications include:\n",
    "Multiple skill groups with different handle times\n",
    "- Agent shrinkage (breaks, meetings, training) reducing effective capacity\n",
    "- Occupancy limits (agents cannot work at 100% utilization - they burn out)\n",
    "- Routing rules (which queues can be handled by which agent groups)\n",
    "- Time-varying demand across 48 intervals per day\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "The Mathematics: Two Complementary Approaches\n",
    "1. Erlang-C: The Performance Model\n",
    "Erlang-C answers: \"Given N agents, volume V, and handle time H, what is the wait time and occupancy?\"\n",
    "Key Insight: Erlang-C is a constraint checker, not an optimizer. It tells you if a solution is feasible, but not what the optimal solution is.\n",
    "2. Linear/Nonlinear Programming: The Optimization Framework\n",
    "This is where we find the minimum cost solution subject to constraints:\n",
    "minimize:    Sum of headcount_i              (minimize total workforce)\n",
    "\n",
    "subject to:  ASA(headcount) <= patience      (service level constraint)\n",
    "             occupancy(headcount) <= max_occ (utilization constraint)\n",
    "             headcount_min <= headcount <= max (capacity bounds)\n",
    "Key Insight: The objective function is simple (minimize headcount), but the constraints are nonlinear because ASA and occupancy are computed via Erlang-C formulas.\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Your Learning Path\n",
    "Phase 1: Understand the Individual Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Review Erlang-C deeply\n",
    "Implement Erlang-C from scratch in Python\n",
    "Understand the Pw (probability of wait) formula and why it is nonlinear\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Learn Constrained Optimization basics\n",
    "Start with linear programming (LP) using scipy.optimize.linprog\n",
    "Solve simple problems: resource allocation, diet problem, production planning\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 2: Bridge the Gap\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Understand Nonlinear Optimization\n",
    "Graduate from LP to constrained nonlinear optimization\n",
    "Learn about feasible regions, active constraints, and local vs. global optima\n",
    "Tools: scipy.optimize.minimize with constraints\n",
    "Try: Minimize headcount with a simplified Erlang-C constraint\n",
    "4. Study Real Solvers\n",
    "Look at golden section search for single-variable problems\n",
    "Understand why gradient-free methods are used (Erlang-C has no closed-form gradient)\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Find: Minimum headcount of agents needed given the demand data\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "Implement Erlang-C calculation\n",
    "Use scipy.optimize.minimize or write a simple search algorithm\n",
    "Print: optimal headcount, resulting ASA, resulting occupancy\n",
    "Validate: manually verify your Erlang-C outputs against online calculators\n",
    "\n",

    "The Big Picture\n",
    "This problem combines:\n",
    "Queueing Theory (Erlang-C) - to model system behavior\n",
    "Optimization Theory (LP/NLP) - to find the best solution\n",
    "Software Engineering - to make it fast and scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not just learning math; you are learning how to engineer solutions to real-world operations problems that companies like Amazon, Uber, and call centers use every day.\n",
