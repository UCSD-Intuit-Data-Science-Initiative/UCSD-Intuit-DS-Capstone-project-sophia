# Supply-Demand Group Headcount Forecasting

>Note: For the DSC 180A Quarter 1 Project Checkpoint - Code, please visit the notebooks folder in this repo to review my code. My progress has been slower in the past 5 weeks as I had to take the time to gain a better understanding of the business context of workforce management and develop a technical foundation for time series. I also served as the documentarian for our section and took the lead on designing and creating the presentation for our TA Check-In and project report.

## Introduction

Intuit, a leading financial software company, offers products like TurboTax and QuickBooks, and connects users with live experts through its Virtual Expert Platform (VEP). This platform’s operational efficiency relies heavily on accurate demand forecasting and precise supply planning. By effectively matching expert availability with user needs, Intuit ensures timely support and maintains cost-effectiveness.

Forecasting models in workforce management set the stage for everything else. The expectation is to accurately capture when, how much, and what kind of demand will show up. For example, it’s not enough to know that thousands of customers will seek help next week — the models must account for hourly patterns, seasonal spikes, and even unexpected events. Accuracy matters because small errors in forecasts ripple downstream, leading to overstaffing (higher costs) or understaffing (longer wait times and lower customer satisfaction).

On the supply planning side, the challenge is about optimization under constraints. Supply planning requires building staffing schedules that balance multiple, often conflicting requirements, such as ensuring the right mix of skills (e.g., tax experts vs. bookkeeping experts), covering peak hours without burning out the team, staying within budget and labor regulations, and allowing flexibility for last-minute changes when forecasts shift.day-to-day.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd <repo>
make install        # installs dependencies & pre-commit hooks
make lint           # sanity-check tooling
make test           # run the sample unit tests
make pipeline-run   # execute the demo training pipeline
```

Poetry 1.8+ is required. If Poetry is not already installed, follow the [official instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

## Tooling Highlights

- **Poetry** – dependency and environment management (`make install`).
- **Ruff** – linting & formatting (`make lint`, `make format`).
- **mypy** – static type checks to catch bugs early.
- **Tox** – orchestrates lint/type/test/coverage in isolated envs (`poetry run tox`).
- **Pytest** – unit test runner with coverage configured.
- **Loguru** – opinionated logging with contextual helpers.
- **Pre-commit** – consistent formatting & linting before commits.
- **GitHub Pages ready docs** – `docs/` contains the scaffolding for project documentation.
